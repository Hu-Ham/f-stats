This is an education and graphics  tool project to calculate the three core F-statistics, FST,FIS and FIT. These statistics work by measuring degree of homozygosity by descent as a mean sof estimating population distance and inbreeding. FIS represents individual differential allele frequences across sub population, FIT represents the same but across the total population. FST is a measure of the differential alleic variation in subpopulation from total population. It can be thought of as a measure of the degree of deviation from an expected heterozygosity due to the effects of genetic drift on a local subpopulationn/deme.
