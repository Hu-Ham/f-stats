This is an education and graphics tool project to calculate the three core F-statistics, FST, FIS and FIT. These statistics work by measuring degree of homozygosity by descent as a means of estimating population distance and inbreeding. FIS represents individual differential allele frequencies across sub population, FIT represents the same but across the total population. FST is a measure of the differential allelic variation in subpopulation from total population. It can be thought of as a measure of the degree of deviation from an expected heterozygosity of the total population due to the effects of genetic drift on a local subpopulation/deme.
